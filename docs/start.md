# Welcome to Catalyst

Thanks for checking out Catalyst! [What is Catalyst?](https://www.catalystmonitor.com)

## When does Catalyst shine?

You will benefit most from Catalyst if the following describes your situation:

- You are building a complex web application
- Your server serves HTTP endpoints that returns HTTP error codes 
- Your team deploys relatively often

If you fall under these criteria, Catalyst aims to be a drop-in monitoring solution that requires minimal effort to get going.

## Catalyst is under development!

Interfaces are subject to change! Please only use Catalyst if you are okay with a bit of instability.

We are still adding support for libraries and frameworks. If your library and or framework isn't supported, feel free to reach out either [through e-mail](mailto:bill@privium.xyz) or [via Discord](https://discord.gg/YQZy4SXzmX).
