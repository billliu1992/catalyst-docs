# Instrumenting for other languages and frameworks

Currently, Catalyst has a client library for Node.js and the browser, with additional libraries provided for Express and React Router.

Catalyst passes information via HTTP, so it can theoretically be used with any language or framework. If you'd like to see Catalyst for your framework/language of choice, please reach out either [through e-mail](mailto:bill@privium.xyz) or [via Discord](https://discord.gg/YQZy4SXzmX).
